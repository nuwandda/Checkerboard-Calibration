# Checkerboard Calibration
The checkerboard calibration only requires two planes, and only the corner points of the black and white grids are needed to mark, which is much easier than the original calibration. All in all, the significance of the checkerboard calibration is to overcome the shortcomings of the high-precision calibration objects required by the traditional calibration method, and only need to use a printed checkerboard.</br>
